            <br>
            <dd>
                In our project, we designed a metal detector using electromagnetic waves, employing a transmitter coil to emit a magnetic field and a receiver coil to detect disturbances caused by metal objects. Our project demonstrated the practical application of electromagnetic waves in metal detection, showcasing the principles of electromagnetism and their application in a functional and efficient metal detector system.

            <dd>
                Our project focused on utilizing ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, where we employed a transceiver module to emit ultrasonic waves and measure their reflection to detect nearby obstacles. Our project showcased the effectiveness of ultrasonic sensors in detecting obstacles in real-time, offering potential applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other areas where obstacle detection is crucial for safe navigation.
